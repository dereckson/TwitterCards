TwitterCards
============

This is MediaWiki Extension:TwitterCards

Twitter describes this feature like this:
Twitter cards make it possible for you to attach media experiences to Tweets that link to your content. Simply add a few lines of HTML to your webpages, and users who Tweet links to your content will have a "card" added to the Tweet thatâ€™s visible to all of their followers. It would be really nice for articles, images, videos - everything linked from Wikimedia on Twitter could have a nice little preview on Twitter. The documentation is at TwitterCards - basically it involves adding some meta tags around existing content server-side.
